                    MEXT with Rishiisan provides educational guidance, preparation support, and informational resources
                    for students interested in the MEXT (Japanese Government) Scholarship and studying in Japan.

                    We are <strong>not affiliated with or endorsed by MEXT, the Government of Japan, Japanese embassies,
                    or any official institution</strong>. All information shared here is intended to support learning,
                    awareness, and preparation only.

                <p>
                    While we aim to guide and support you to the best of our ability, selection for the MEXT Scholarship
                    depends on several factors such as exam performance, interview results, academic background,
                    competition level, and official evaluation by embassies and authorities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because these decisions are made entirely by official bodies, we are unable to guarantee
                    scholarship selection, exam success, interview outcomes, or university admission.
                    Our goal is to help you prepare with clarity and confidence, while being transparent about
                    the process.
